## Motor driver

A motor driver is a breakout board that consists of a motor driver integrated circuit (IC).
A motor driver is basically the same as a current amplifier, and its main purpose is to take a low-current signal and convert to a high-current signal in order to run the motors.

The main reason why we need a motor driver is that components such as motors cannot be connected directly to the Raspberry Pi as they do not get sufficient current from the Raspberry Pi
